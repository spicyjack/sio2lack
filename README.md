## What is this? ##

An Atari Serial I/O (SIO) [LACK](http://code.google.com/p/lack) appliance, or
a LACK appliance that serves up content as an Atari SIO device would.  Using a
[SIO2PC](http://pages.suddenlink.net/wa5bdu/siofaq.htm) cable adapter and the
[sio2linux](http://www.crowcastle.net/preston/atari/) program, this appliance
will simulate an Atari disk drive, so that Atari computers can load up files
as if there was a real physical disk drive connected to the machine.
