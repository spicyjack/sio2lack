## What is this? ##

An Atari Serial I/O (SIO) LACK appliance, or a LACK appliance that serves up
content as an Atari SIO device would.  Using a `SIO2PC` cable adapter and the
`sio2linux` program, this appliance will simulate an Atari disk drive, so that
Atari computers can load up files as if there was a real physical disk drive
connected to the machine.
